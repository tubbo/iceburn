{"name":"Iceburn","tagline":"HTTP request hijacker for Rails apps which use a client-side JS app as a frontend","body":"# Iceburn\r\n\r\nA quick and dirty Rails plugin for client-side javascript apps. Adds\r\nfilters to your controller and routes to your router to allow a\r\nclient-side JS app to take over the entire page.\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\nInstall the gem with Bundler:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ngem 'iceburn'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdd the following line to **config/routes.rb**:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nRails.application.routes.draw do\r\n  iceburn_html!\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this to `ApplicationController`:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass ApplicationController < ActionController::Base\r\n  before_action :filter_html_requests\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nTo whitelist controllers, define a whitelist:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass ApplicationController < ActionController::Base\r\n  iceburn_whitelist 'devise/sessions'\r\n  before_action :filter_html_requests\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will not run the `filter_html_requests` method on such controllers,\r\nas they interfere with the normal process.\r\n\r\nYou also get a \"free\" route that points to 'application#index' and just\r\nreturns an empty string, allowing your JS app to take over the layout.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n[University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License][ncsa]\r\n\r\n    Copyright (c) 2014 Tom Scott\r\n    All rights reserved.\r\n\r\n    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\r\n    a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"),\r\n    to deal with the Software without restriction, including without limitation\r\n    the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense,\r\n    and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\r\n    Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\n    Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice,\r\n    this list of conditions and the following disclaimers.\r\n\r\n    Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,\r\n    this list of conditions and the following disclaimers in the documentation\r\n    and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\r\n\r\n    None of the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote\r\n    products derived from this Software without specific prior written permission.\r\n\r\n    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,\r\n    INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\r\n    PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
